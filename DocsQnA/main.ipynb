Introduction\\nA ﬁber graph is a graph on the ﬁnitely many lattice points F ⊂Zd of a polytope where\\ntwo lattice points are connected by an edge if their diﬀerence lies in a ﬁnite set of allowed\\nmoves M ⊂Zd. The implicit structure of these graphs makes them a useful tool to explore\\nthe set of lattice points randomly: At the current lattice point u ∈F, an element m ∈±M\\nis sampled and the random walk moves along m if u + m ∈F and stays at u otherwise.\\nThe corresponding Markov chain is irreducible if the underlying ﬁber graph is connected and\\nthe set M is called a Markov basis for F in this case. This paper investigates the heat-bath\\nversion of this random walk: At the current lattice point u ∈F, we sample m ∈M and move\\nto a random element in the integer ray (u + Z · m) ∩F. The authors of [6] discovered that\\nthis random walk can be seen as a discrete version of the hit-and-run algorithm [15, 26, 16]\\nthat has been used frequently to sample from all the points of a polytope – not only from its\\nlattice points. The popularity of the continuous version of the hit-and-run algorithm has not\\nspread to its discrete analog, and not much is known about its mixing behaviour. One reason\\nis that it is already challenging to guarantee that all points in the underlying set F can be\\nDate: September 12, 2018.\\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation.

However, in many situations where a Markov\\nbasis is known, the heat-bath random walk is evidently fast. For instance, it was shown in [3]\\nthat the heat-bath random walk on contingency tables mixes rapidly when the number of\\ncolumns is ﬁxed. To work around the connectedness issue, a discrete hit-and-run algorithm\\nwas introduced in [1] for arbitrary ﬁnite sets F ⊂Zd. At each step in this random walk, a\\nsubordinate and unrestricted random walk starts at the current lattice point u ∈F and uses\\nthe unit vectors to collect a set of proposals S ⊂Zd. The random walk then moves from u\\nto a random point in S ∩F.\\nRandom walks of the heat-bath type, such as the one presented above, have been studied\\nrecently in [8] in a more general context. In this paper, we explore the mixing behaviour of\\nheat-bath random walks on the lattice points of polytopes with Markov bases. Throughout,\\nwe assume that a Markov basis has been found already and refer to the relevant literature\\nfor their computation [24, 25, 11, 17, 10, 21]. We call the underlying graph of the heat-bath\\nrandom walk a compressed ﬁber graph (Deﬁnition 2.5) and determine in Section 3 bounds on\\nits graph-diameter. We prove that for any A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A)∩Nd = {0}, the diameter of\\ncompressed ﬁber graphs on {u ∈Nd : Au = b} that use a ﬁxed Markov bases M ⊂kerZ(A) is\\nbounded from above by a constant as b varies (Theorem 3.15). In contrast, we show that the\\ndiameter of conventional ﬁber graphs grow linearly under a dilation of the underlying polytope\\n(Remark 3.9). This gives rise to slow mixing results for conventional ﬁber walks as ')]"

INTRODUCTION\\nRecent advancements in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\\ntechnologies, computing and sensor technologies, allowed use\\nof UAVs for various earth observation applications. Many\\nUAV systems are equipped with multiple cameras today, as\\ncameras provide reasonable and relatively reliable information\\nabout the surrounding scene in the form of multiple images\\nor image pairs. Such image pairs can be taken by different\\ncameras, at different view-points, different modalities or at\\ndifferent resolutions. In such situations, the same objects or the\\nsame features might appear at different coordinates on each\\nimage and, therefore, an image alignment (registration) step\\nis needed prior to applying many other image based computer\\nvision applications such as image fusion, object detection,\\nsegmentation or object tracking as in [45]–[47].\\nThe infrared spectrum and visible spectrum may reflect\\ndifferent properties of the same scene. Consequently, images\\ntaken in those modalities, typically, differ from each other. On\\nmany digital cameras, the visible spectrum is captured and\\nstored in the form of Red-Green-Blue (RGB) image model and\\na typical visible spectrum camera captures visible light ranging\\nfrom approximately 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers in\\nwavelength [7], [8], [37]. Infrared cameras, on the other hand,\\nBoth authors are with the Ozer Lab, Dept. of Computer Science, Ozyegin\\nUniversity, Istanbul, Turkiye.

The IIR is shown in pseu-\\ndocolors. Both images are given as input to the registration\\nstage where the transformation parameters represented by the\\nhomography matrix (H) are predicted. After the registration\\nprocess, the IIR is transformed (warped) onto the IRGB space\\nby locating the positions of c1, c2, c3, and c4 as c′\\n1, c′\\n2, c′\\n3,\\nand c′\\n4.
